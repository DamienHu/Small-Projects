# Ollama Integration Tutorial

This repository showcases my experience integrating Ollama, an open-source Local Learning Model (LLM) tool, into various projects.

## Setup and Configuration

To set up Ollama, I followed these steps:
### Model Pulling
* Retrieved pre-trained models from the Ollama model hub using their API.
### API Customization
* Configured REST APIs to interact with the integrated LLMs.
### Python Integrations
* Utilized Python libraries to integrate with local LLMs, such as `ollama-python`.
